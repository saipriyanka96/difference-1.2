Differentiate between JVM,JDK and JRE

A Java virtual machine is an abstract camputing machine that enables a computer to run a 
Java Program,mechanism which translates the byte code into native executables code either 
by using the java interpreter or Just in Time Compiler. It is also includedwith some other 
tools like Garbage collector to free the unused objects and Thread Synchronization mechanism 
to control  multiple processed to execute multiple functions at a time using single processor.

Java RuntimeEnvironment(JRE)is a software package that contains what is required to run a 
java program.It is the combination of JVM and with some other tools like class Loader,Byte
code verifier,Java API and Runtime libraries. A computer must be installed with the total 
JRE to run any application

Java Development Kit(JDK) is asuperset of JRE and contain tools for java programmers.It
would provide many tools to go with the developlment process of any java program.
